### Files for my [website](www.hashm.tech) 

created with [gitfolio](https://github.com/imfunniee/gitfolio) and modified by me :)

I use cron to run my updater shell script ever 6 hours which in turn stops my webserver, updates my 'gitfolio' repos, reaplies my changes such as rounded icons, diffrent socials links, spelling, etc. and restarts my webserver.
