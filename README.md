### Files for my [website](www.hashm.tech) 

The website was created with [gitfolio](https://github.com/imfunniee/gitfolio)
I then wrote a program for the webserver and an updater script to update the repos and changes some of the html.

I use crontab to run my updater shell script every hour which in turn stops my webserver, updates my 'gitfolio' repos, reaplies my changes such as rounded icons, diffrent socials links, spelling, etc. and restarts my webserver.
